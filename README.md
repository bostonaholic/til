# Today I Learned

This is a repository of things I've learned as I go about my day. TILs are short Markdown documents explaining concepts, syntax, commands, or other developer tips I've recently learned.

This repository is inspired by [TILs from Thoughtbot][thoughtbot-tils].

For new TILs, follow me on [Twitter][twitter].
